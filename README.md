# Infinite Workout Server

## Run this project with docker-compose

Recommended way of running local server is using `docker-compose up`. It will install all python and system dependencies inside the container and run local server with live reload. You can configure it to use/not use PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL and SQLite are only options for now.

### Interact with container

With these command you can run executables in your container:

```
docker-compose exec <service-name> <executable>
```

- **Create superuser**

```
docker-compose exec infinite-workout-server ./manage.py createsuperuser
```

- **Open python shell**

```
docker-compose exec infinite-workout-server ./manage.py shell
```

## Run this project without docker-compose

### Prepare poetry

```bash
# Clone repository
